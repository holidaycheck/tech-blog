# Apprenticeship Week #1

We have the [website] where one can find all the information about the apprenticeship, we [have][post-1] [published][post-2] [a couple][post-3] [of blog posts][post-4] about it, even former [apprentices][ex-apprentices-post-1] [have written][ex-apprentices-post-2] how it was meanwhile and after the apprenticeship.

What I would like to focus on now, is: What is it like once I started it? What’s the expectation, the tasks and the environment looking like in which it will take place.
In other words: if you like the program and think it’s cool, I want to lay out here what it really means and how the first days will be run, so you can get a better picture of (the start of) the real life as an apprentice.

# Day 1 - Preface

I personally can’t imagine how overwhelming it will be for someone starting as an apprentice. If I just think back to my first job and the unknown fields I was walking into, the expectations and unknowns that existed. On top the apprenticeship adds a new way of starting into a job. I am sure that there are questions in some people’s mind like “Why do I get payed to learn?” or “What do I really need to deliver?”. Combining all this and taking some of the unknowns into account, we are aiming to make it as comfortable as possible for the apprentices when they start.

The day(s) before a new apprentice starts we organize a laptop, the table, some gadgets and a number of niceties to decorate their future desk. I learned from the past, that I need to take care of the computer being ready the moment they get to their desk. I must have the password at hand and the apprentice must be able to log in and start using the computer the very moment. I had screwed that up before, this was one learning. But that was just a side note.
Having the desk, accounts, computer, who is the mentor, who is the manager and all organizational things done before is really helpful and makes the start much smoother. And is a no brainer in my opinion.

# Day 1

Day 1 starts for the apprentice at 10:00. We ask new apprentices   to come to our front desk at 10:00 the first day. At that time a couple of people from HolidayCheck will be there expecting you and welcoming you. We all say “hello” but seeing that everyone is overwhelmed with so many new faces, we don’t go more into detail about roles, etc., names are enough for the start.
We walk together to their prepared desks and ensure multiple times that the first week is all about getting settled, feeling comfortable and taking it easy.
At 11:30 we go for lunch together, we show the apprentices what options there are and help to make the first day as pleasant as possible.
In the afternoon we give a 1 hour presentation about the apprenticeship, to explain in detail the two core structures of the apprenticeship, which are 1) the six categories and 2) the three phases, more about that later.
We explain that being an apprentice means to learn at one’s own speed, it means to be responsible for organizing the learnings oneself, it means deliberate learning at the speed that fits the apprentice, it means to take the time to dive and to learn when to skip or drop a topic, it means to get an overview of many things that are important in our industry. Most and foremost the learning is done by the apprentices themselves guided by the mentor, there is no classroom-style learning. The mindset of never-ending learning is one thing we expect to be shared and to carry into the company.
After first detailed introduction we pass the five tasks to the apprentices, that are planned for the first week. Those five tasks are:
- set up a blog
- write a first blog post
- self assessment
- work off the set of onboarding items (things like 
- attend a first kata

To ensure that the tasks won’t be forgotten, we normally put them down on a whiteboard near their desks. This allows the apprentices to check off the according tasks and get a sense of progress. Yep, that is a trigger for the self-organization.

# Daily routine

The apprentices that started this year in September and October received the task to organize their daily for the second or third day. The question “What is a daily?” was easily given back to the apprentices. So they went and found out what a daily is, why it should be done and so on.
