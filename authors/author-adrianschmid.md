# Adrian Schmid

Hi there! I'm Adrian, a Fullstack Software Engineer who loves bringing order to the coding chaos. I'm comfortable with JavaScript, NodeJS, React, and PHP, and I've dabbled in Java and Scala stacks too. I enjoy working on projects of all kinds and sizes.

As a certified IT Business Manager, I bring not only technical prowess but also project management finesse to the table. From legacy systems to cutting-edge frameworks, I thrive on diverse challenges.

I started my career in the marketing industry, freelanced and most recently founded a digital agency called [builtbright]. I joined HolidayCheck in 2021 where I manage projects and implement and design software solutions as part of the UGC team.
